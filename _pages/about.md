LibrariesWest is a partnership of seven public library services in the south west of England. The services work together to share costs and offer enhanced services to customers. Dorset and Poole have joined existing members Bath & North East Somerset, Bristol, North Somerset, Somerset and South Gloucestershire, resulting in a 'coast to coast' service.Â 

One of the key aspects of LibrariesWest is a shared catalogue, and a shared systems team managing the single Library Management System (LMS).

We are a small team but keen to engage with other library services and the public in sharing open data, and seeing what more can be done with library data.
