[LibrariesWest](https://www.librarieswest.org.uk) is a partnership of seven public library services in the south west of England. The services work together to share costs and offer enhanced services to customers. One of the key aspects of LibrariesWest is a shared catalogue, and a systems team managing our single Library Management System (LMS).

We are keen to engage with other library services, and the public, in sharing open data, experiences, and seeing what can be done with library data and technology.
