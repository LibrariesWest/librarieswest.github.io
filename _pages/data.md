We use library data quite a lot, and you are welcome to do so as well.

Our open data is made available on our [open data repository](https://github.com/LibrariesWest/opendata), and direct links are also included below. But because a lot of it delves into the workings of library systems (reservations, issues, etc) we have created documentation that describes the context of the data, and how it is created. By all means get stuck straight into the data, but if delving any deeper into it then please check out the documentation as well!
