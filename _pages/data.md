We use library data quite a lot, and you are welcome to do so as well.

Our open data is made available on our [open data GitHub repository](https://github.com/LibrariesWest/opendata). But because a lot of it delves into the workings of library systems (reservations, issues, etc) we have created documentation that describes the context of the data, how it is created, and gives general documentation of the datasets. By all means get stuck straight into the data, but if delving any deeper into it then please check out the documentation as well!
