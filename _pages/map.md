We release open data on the location of our current active users. Not their home addresses, no one wants to know that. But counts of active users per Lower Super Output area, small areas that have other statistic released about them such as income and health deprivation.

Doing this allows us to consider the reach of the library services. Combining with population data allows us to judge what percentage of the population in each area are active library users.

Having this data current and up to date allows us to monitor this, and there's no reason the public shouldn't be able to monitor it as well. The map on this page shows each LSOA and the current active membership levels in that area.
