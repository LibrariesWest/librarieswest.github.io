We release open data on the locations of our active users. Not home addresses, but counts per [Lower Super Output Area](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeography#super-output-area-soa) (LSOA), small areas used for statistics. The map on this page shows each LSOA in LibrariesWest, and the current active membership levels. Hover over each area for more information.
