We release open data on the locations of our active users. Not home addresses, no one wants to know that. But counts per [Lower Super Output Area](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeography#super-output-area-soa) (LSOA), small geographic areas that have other statistics released about them such as income and health deprivation. The map on this page shows each LSOA and the current active membership levels in that area.
