LibrariesWest is a partnership of seven public library services in the south west of England. The services work together to share costs and offer enhanced services to customers. Dorset and Poole have joined existing members Bath & North East Somerset, Bristol, North Somerset, Somerset and South Gloucestershire, resulting in a 'coast to coast' service.

This is a systems team blog to publish thoughts on reporting, open data, and open developments with our Library Management System (LMS) and web catalogue.

Where possible and appropriate, open data and open source projects will be released via our [GitHub account](https://github.com/librarieswest).
