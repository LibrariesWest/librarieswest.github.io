LibrariesWest are based in Bridgwater, Somerset.  Walking around at lunchtime on a couple of days in November it was noticeable that almost no-one was around the High Street, outside, or in the shops or cafes.  This wasn't anything to do with the location, but the fact that it was pouring with rain, and had been for most of the day.  This was storm Angus, [bringing 80mph winds and flooding to the UK](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/20/storm-angus-brings-80mph-winds-and-flooding-to-the-uk/). 

This led to pondering how the weather - and particularly rainfall in this case - affects library usage.  Not just on the scale of one library, but for a region (assuming the weather is significant enough - 'big' weather).  What this needs is two things, historical usage data (e.g. issues), and historical climate data.

Looking around for historic climate information can be difficult.  There is good monthly information released by the Met office for many weather stations, but monthly isn't accurate enough to analyse against library usage.  There is openly licensed live data with detailed forecasts available, so in theory these could be collected and then used as historical data.  But of course these are **forecasts**, they're likely to be the opposite of what actually happened.

HadUKP is a series of datasets of UK precipitation (rainfall).  The data is released by regions: Northern Scotland, Eastern Scotland, Southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, North West, North East, Central, South West and Wales, and South East.  So it's not very accurate if you need something localised to a city but for matching with LibrariesWest usage data the South West region fits OK.  See this post on the [Geography of LibrariesWest](https://librarieswest.github.io/2016/11/21/reporting-geography/).

Firstly we'll look at rain.  HadUKP provide a file for South West England and Wales Daily totals.

The data is a plain text file and looks like this:

```
Daily Southwest England & Wales precipitation (mm). Values may change after QC.
Alexander & Jones (2001, Atmospheric Science Letters).
Format=Year, Month, 1-31 daily precipitation values.
 1931    1   0.60   3.70   3.00   0.40   0.00   0.00   0.00   0.50   0.60   0.60   6.71   0.80   0.00   1.30   1.10   3.30   1.50   3.80   3.90   0.60   9.71  15.01   5.61   1.60   4.40   0.50   5.00   6.51   3.20   2.20  17.42
 1931    2   0.30   1.00   0.00   0.10   6.61   2.31   1.00   7.12  10.02   2.31  10.42   3.51   1.80   3.01   2.71   4.21   3.11   0.10   3.31   3.51   0.40   1.20   0.20   1.60   4.51   3.21  10.22   3.11 -99.99 -99.99 -99.99
...
```

The format looks tricky to deal with but it's not too bad.  Ignoring the first 3 lines (documentation), each line is then a series of values separated by spaces.  The first value will always be the year (it starts from 1931), the second the month, and then a value for each day.  It always has 31 values for the days; in cases where there aren't actually 31 days in the month, the value provided is -99.99. 

In the [LibrariesWest GitHub opendata repository](https://github.com/LibrariesWest/opendata/tree/master/weather) we have a script that will convert this data into a slightly easier CSV (comma separated values) format.  The data ends up looking more like this: 



See [this file on GitHub](https://github.com/LibrariesWest/opendata/blob/master/weather/HadSWEP.csv).

We went live with a new Library Management System in June, so for simplicity we'll only consider data from then.  It's possible that renewals would be less likely to be affected by weather, as people are less required to visit a library to renew an item.  So we'll get renewal data as well but keep it separate from issues.

There will of course be differences between different days of the week, due to changing patterns of user behaviour and a different profile of opening hours.  So we can only reasonably compare usage counts between particular days of the week.  Here is a selection of the data, where we have days of 'big rain' compared to no rain.

| Date | Day of week | Precipitation | Issues | Renewals |
| --- | ----------- | ------------- | ------ | -------- |
| 2016-11-12 | | 1.38 | |   |
| 2016-11-13 | | 0.17 |  |   |
| 2016-11-14 | | 1.76 |  |  |
| 2016-11-19 | | 25.67 |  |  |
| 2016-11-20 | |  |  |  |
| 2016-11-21 | |  |  |  |


Looking at this we have the first week of almost no rain (1.38, 0.17, 1.76) and then a belter of Angus chcuking down rain for three days.  It doesn't appear that there is much difference between the days of lots of rain and no rain.

Hmmmmm.  It doesn't really look like the storm had much effect on library use.
