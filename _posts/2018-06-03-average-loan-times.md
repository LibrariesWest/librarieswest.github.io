Across LibrariesWest there are some variations in how long we lend things out for, this can change depending on item type and library service, and some other things. But most LibrariesWest users will know that a book loan is generally 3 weeks.

That's probably a sensible length of time, though if someone's taking out Lord of the Rings it may take longer than a small novelette (even if skipping the appendices like everyone does).

Having standard loan periods are necessary. While it'd be great to have a librarian feel the heft of a book, eye up it's content and say 'I reckon that'll take you a couple of weeks', our systems work in fairly limited parameters and people want familiarity and stability.
