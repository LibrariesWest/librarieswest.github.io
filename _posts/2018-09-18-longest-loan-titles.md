title: Books people hold onto
description: What books stay on loan for the longest time?
published: true

We did a small analysis in July on how long different types of items tend to stay out on loan. See [Average loan times](/average-loan-times) for that post.

What about particular titles though? Which books do people keep for ages before returning? Presumably (but not necessarily) those that have the most pages and take the longest to read?

Before doing the analysis we need to set some rules:

- We'll include issues from across the whole of LibrariesWest
- We will take an average loan length, in days, for each title, and list the top 10
- The title will have to have been issued at least 100 times to get a decent average

So, here are the results:

| Title | ISBN | Average Number of days | Issues |
| ----- | ---- | -----------------------|------- |
| The feeling good handbook | 0452281326 | 91 | 142 |
| Computing made easy for the over 50s | 9781844901128 | 89 | 102 |
| The mindful way through depression | 9781593851286 | 85 | 182 |
| Overcoming low self-esteem | 9781849010689 | 84 | 179 |
| Raising girls | 9780007455669 | 84 | 163 |
| This changes everything | 9781846145056 | 80 | 113 |
| Overcoming depression | 9781849010665 | 80 | 220 |
| Break free from OCD | 9780091939694 | 79 | 172 |
| Windows 10 Simplified | 9781119057154 | 77 | 173 |
| Calm parents, happy kids | 9780091955205 | 76 | 102 |

The results are overwhelmingly on managing wellbeing, or else helping with computing. Perhaps not so surprisingly, though nothing to do with the length of the book. The average loan times post had already shown an above average loan time for our 'Books on Prescription' titles, this further shows a certain number of particular titles that people really keep hold of.

The feeling good handbook manages a huge average of 91 days on loan. Thankfully there are [plenty of copies available](https://www.librarieswest.org.uk/client/en_GB/default/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_ILS$002f0$002fSD_ILS:825639/one?qu=0452281326&te=ILS&rt=false%7C%7C%7CISBN%7C%7C%7CISBN).
