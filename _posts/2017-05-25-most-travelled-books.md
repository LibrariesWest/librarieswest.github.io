We often report on the number of times an item in the LibrariesWest catalogue is issued. Or, items with the highest number of issues/renewals.

There are clearly good reasons for keeping an eye on this data. Popularity of stock gives insight into what people want, and how often particular titles (such as Books on Prescription titles) are being issued. It can also provide data on the condition of items, and shelf-life of an item with relation to it's use. A bit like how a car's mileage is as important as its age.

Mileage of a book is interesting. The number of issues may be a good usage indicator for a book, but a book will also have a travel distance. Where has it been taken in its lifetime? That might include travel between libraries, and to user locations such as a home address, as well as far more difficult things such as where it was printed, etc.

Distance travelled is particularly interesting in LibrariesWest, as we have a shared catalogue between 7 different library authorities. Any member of LibrariesWest can take out a book from any library, and return it at any library. They can also place a reservation for an item held by any library, and pick it up in any library. That could be as far ranging as between a South Gloucestershire library and a Poole one.  And this isn't just normal inter-library lending between authorities, which is usually relatively small figures, this is day-to-day usage of the system.

How can we measure the distance travelled by a book? For every issue we know the library that it was issued in, the library that it was returned in, and we know the library that the item is normally held at. We know very little about what happens to the item when it's held by the user. They may take it on holiday or carry it around when commuting. Although it may be nice to know where people take books, let's assume they just take it home. So, we can then assume a very basic 'route' for a book (or item).

- Book is sent from holding library to issuing library;
- Book is collected by user and taken home;
- Book is taken by user to return library;
- Book is sent from return library to holding library.

Calculating the total distance for that route requires location data for the libraries involved and the home address of the user. For this kind of analysis, the postcode is generally accurate enough, and we use postcode location data taken from Ordnance Survey's open data product [code-point open](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/code-point-open.html), to match to the postcodes we have in the Library Management System.
